### Development Outline for ESP32 Firmware Project

#### 1. **Project Overview**
The project aims to develop firmware for an ESP32 with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support, enabling dynamic configuration based on an identifier pin. The firmware should be flashable over Ethernet, use socketIO for communication with a JS server on a main control network, and support various hardware configurations for digital I/O (DI, DO), PWM, Mosfet switching, I2C, RS485 Modbus, and analog input.

### 2. **Requirements**

#### **Firmware Features:**
- **PoE Support:** Identify and use an ESP32 variant that supports PoE for power and data transmission over Ethernet.
- **Ethernet Flashing:** Firmware must be flashable over Ethernet for ease of updating in field deployments.
- **Dynamic Configuration:**
  - On boot, read an identifier pin connected to a resistor (5V with analog reading) to determine the hardware configuration.
  - The firmware should adapt its functionality based on this analog value.
- **Communication Protocol:**
  - Implement **socketIO** as the communication protocol.
  - The firmware will interface with a JavaScript server to receive commands and report statuses over the control network.
- **I2C, RS485 Modbus Support:** Ensure the firmware supports I2C and RS485 Modbus protocols for additional peripherals.
- **Multi-Protocol Handling:**
  - Support for DI (Digital Input), DO (Digital Output), PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), and analog inputs.
  - Mosfet switching support to control high-current loads.

### 3. **Hardware Specifications:**

#### **ESP32 Selection:**
- **ESP32 with PoE support**: Identify an ESP32 variant or module that has built-in PoE capabilities. One potential option is the ESP32-POE-ISO board by Olimex, but more research is required to determine the best fit for the project.
- **Ethernet Interface**: The ESP32 should have an integrated Ethernet MAC or support external PHY for Ethernet connectivity.

#### **Development Board:**
- A custom **development board** will be designed to allow testing of each hardware component:
  - **Digital Inputs (DI)**: Test multiple DI circuits for sensing switches, sensors, or other binary states.
  - **Digital Outputs (DO)**: Support for driving relays, LEDs, or external logic circuits.
  - **PWM Outputs**: Enable testing of variable power control circuits (e.g., motor controllers, dimmers).
  - **Mosfet Switching**: Allow the control of high-power devices (e.g., lights, fans) through Mosfets.
  - **I2C Communication**: For interfacing with external sensors or peripherals.
  - **RS485 Modbus**: Enable communication with industrial devices over RS485.
  - **Analog Input**: Test sensors or voltage levels that provide analog signals.
  
Each circuit example on the dev board can be modular and alacarte, allowing easy configuration and testing of individual setups.

### 4. **Firmware Features:**

#### **Dynamic Configuration by Identifier Pin:**
- **Identifier Pin Setup**: 
  - A dedicated analog pin will read the voltage (from 0 to 5V) through a resistor, and based on the analog value, the ESP32 will configure its behavior (e.g., number of inputs/outputs, communication protocols enabled, etc.).
  - This allows flexibility for different hardware configurations by simply changing the identifier pin's resistance.

#### **SocketIO for Communication:**
- Use socketIO to communicate with a JavaScript server on a central control network. This will allow:
  - **Real-time data exchange**: Instant reporting of sensor readings, output states, and other information to the server.
  - **Command Reception**: The server can send commands (e.g., turn on an output, change PWM duty cycle, etc.) that the ESP32 will execute.

### 5. **Development Milestones:**

#### **Milestone 1: ESP32 and PoE Integration**
- Identify and procure the ESP32 module with PoE support.
- Establish basic connectivity with the control network via Ethernet.

#### **Milestone 2: Firmware Flashing Over Ethernet**
- Implement the ability to flash firmware over Ethernet.
- Test Ethernet-based flashing with different network setups.

#### **Milestone 3: Dynamic Configuration**
- Develop the dynamic configuration mechanism using the identifier pin.
- Test the system's adaptability to different configurations based on the analog value.

#### **Milestone 4: Hardware Development Board**
- Design and prototype a development board with circuit examples for DI, DO, PWM, Mosfet, I2C, RS485, and analog inputs.
- Build and validate the development board for all required functions.

#### **Milestone 5: SocketIO Protocol Implementation**
- Integrate socketIO into the firmware for communication with the control server.
- Test real-time control and reporting functionality.

### 6. **Future Considerations:**
- **Alacarte Board Design**: Based on the circuits tested on the development board, create customizable "a la carte" boards for specific configurations (e.g., a board with more digital inputs or one focused on analog sensing).
- **Security**: Ensure that the communication via socketIO is secure, possibly through encryption (e.g., TLS).
- **Modular Firmware**: Keep the firmware modular to easily add support for more protocols or hardware features as needed.
